# CardioVascular Disease Prediction 

# Introduction :
 
The human cardiovascular system is made up of the heart and blood vessels. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a set of disorders related to  the heart and blood vessels . Annually a large number of people die from CVD . Globally it is the number one cause of death.
The most common cardiovascular disease is coronary artery disease, which can lead to heart attacks ,chest pain or stroke . Diagnosing  the heart condition of the patient is a challenging task . Heart diseases are diagnosed from the signs , symptoms and physical examination of the patient. There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as smoking habit, body cholesterol level, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.
A major challenge faced by healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and medical centres, is the provision of quality services at affordable costs. Our project aims to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease in a person using important features .
There are 3 types of input features:
●	•        Objective: factual information;
●	•        Examination: results of medical examination
●	•        Subjective: information given by the patient.
 
The dataset that we used for our project is from Kaggle . It consists of  70,000 records. The dataset includes 11  features like age , gender , height , weight , blood pressure, cholesterol etc  which were used to predict whether the person has a cardiovascular disease or not .
The dataset that we used consists of both numerical and categorical data. Before further processing, cleaning and filtering are applied on these records in order to filter the irrelevant data from the dataset. 
The proposed system can determine an exact hidden knowledge, ie, patterns and relationships associated with heart disease from a heart disease dataset. It can also answer the complex queries for diagnosing heart disease; therefore, it can be helpful to health care practitioners to make intelligent clinical decisions. Results showed that the proposed system has its unique potency in realizing the objectives of the defined mining goals.
